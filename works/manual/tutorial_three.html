            In this tutorial we will learn how to define the different objects of the ship and
            identify the possible elements that are applicable, such as bulkheads, decks, equipments
            and compartments.            
        </p>

        <p>
            On the end of this tutorial, you will understand what type of objects that compose
            the Vessel.js dataformat and how to create them. After this tutorial, 
            you might be equipped wih the following capabilities:

            <li>
                Learn how to set up new compartments and tanks;
            </li>
            <li>
                Learn the different types of objects that can be defined in the library (equipment, compartment and tanks)
            </li>
        </ul>

            As explained before in the 
            <a href="./tutorial_one.html" target="_blank">First Tutorial</a>, 
            the data JSON format is composed by a set of primitive objects that are defined by the user
            as base objects and derived objects that inherit the linked base objects definition. Now
            we are going to learn how to modify the derived objects states to accommodate different tanks
            filling.
